## Goals

Campus Occupancy is an example web application that provides the visualization of the amount of people in a building. Basically the main goal is to have a map that can also show indoor grouping of visitors. 

## Planned Additions to project

We plan to add ease of access features to make the web application easier for the user. One of these additions would be a slider which filters the population of the building from most dense to least dense.
